        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe was given to me as part of a wedding gift recipe collection from a very dear friend. It is rich, aromatic, flavorful and makes A LOT. </p>
        <p>So please grab the biggest pot you can find. I mean REALLY BIG. Extra sauce freezes well for future pasta dishes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat butter and olive oil together with onion and garlic in a large pot over medium heat;</li>
            <li>Cook and stir ground beef and sausage in the onion mixture until browned and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
            <li>Stir Italian seasoning, salt, rosemary, oregano, and black pepper into ground beef-sausage mixture; simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour water, tomato puree, and tomato paste into ground beef-sausage mixture;</li>
            <li>Simmer, stirring occasionally, over low heat until flavors have combined, at least 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
